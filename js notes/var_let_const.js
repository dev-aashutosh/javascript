/**
 * var:
 * - Used to define a variable.
 * - It has function scope but no block scope.
 * - Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function scope.
 *   This means that the declaration of the variable is moved to the top of its function or global scope during the compilation phase.
 *   However, the initialization of the variable remains in place, so the variable will have an initial value of undefined until it is assigned a value.

/** 
 * let:

 * - Variables declared with let are not hoisted.

/** 
 * const:
 * - It has block scope.
 * - Variables declared with const are not hoisted.
 * - Values must be assigned during initialization and cannot be changed afterwards.
